        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Efekomwan Anthony Oriakhi, born on December 03, in
          Lagos State, Nigeria. I grew up in a bustling household as the fourth
          of six children. My parents instilled in me the values of hard work,
          perseverance, and the importance of family. Growing up in Lagos, a
          city known for its vibrant culture and dynamic lifestyle, and Benin
          City, one of the oldest Kingdoms with a rich cultural heritage, I
          developed a keen sense of adventure and curiosity about the world
          around me.

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of my professional life, I am driven by a passion for
          continuous learning and personal growth. I have a deep-seated interest
          in visiting new places and acquiring new skills. Whether it's
          exploring a new city, learning a new language, or mastering a new
          technology, I approach every opportunity with enthusiasm and a desire
          to expand my horizons. I believe that the knowledge and skills I gain
          can be applied to solve everyday problems, ultimately generating
          income and enhancing the quality of life. I have been self-employed as
          a travel consultant for several years and have some familiarity with
          using computers due to my nature of business. I am also good at arts
          and crafts and have a desire to learn new things. Despite my
          educational background and the time wasted, I have made several
          attempts, such as the CS50 Harvard University free online computer
          course, which I started but stopped at the scratch level using Scratch
          to build games ten years ago. I applied for the Microverse online
          course when it was free three years ago, where I learned how to
          install and use two systems on my computer: Windows and Linux
          "Ubuntu." However, I stopped because I couldn't rectify a bug that I
          knew would reflect in my portfolio if I continued.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My journey is a testament to my resilience, curiosity, and dedication.
          I have built a successful career on my own terms, driven by my passion
          for travel and my commitment to helping others. My story serves as an
          inspiration to those who seek to combine their interests with their
          entrepreneurial aspirations. As I continue to explore the world and
          acquire new skills, I remain focused on using my experiences to create
          value and solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to keep learning, growing, and making a positive impact on
          my community and the world at large. At the end of the program with
          AltSchool Africa, I aim to acquire new skills in Frontend engineering,
          upgrade myself, get certified, and grow in software development and
          beyond. After getting certified, my desire is to use what I have
          learned to develop innovative solutions. I aspire to become a go-to
          expert in the field, solving complex problems, contributing
          meaningfully to the tech industry, and upgrading myself with critical
          thinking to solve everyday problems.
